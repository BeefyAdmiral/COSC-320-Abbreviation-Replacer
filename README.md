# COSC-320-Abbreviation-Replacer
This is my work on Abbreviaton Replacer. This program extracts words and checks if they are possible abbreviation using a prebuilt dictionary and replaces them with their full form.
This project is to showcase on how using a better algorithm we can reduce the computational time of implementing the code. So for the particular alogrithm we have a time complexity of O(n) with worst case as O(n^2) which was reduced from an intial time complexity of O(n^4) (Based on a naive approach).
